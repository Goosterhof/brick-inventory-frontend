# Territory Pulse — _Where Things Stand_

A consolidated, current-state assessment of the frontend codebase. Updated by the CFO at end-of-session. Not chronological — this is the **living snapshot** the architect reads before touching code.

**Rules:**

- Each section carries an `Assessed:` date — update it when you re-evaluate that section
- Sections not revisited keep their old date, making staleness visible
- Overwrite sections with current state — don't append history
- Keep entries factual and concise — one line per item

## Overall Health

**Rating:** 9/10
**Assessed:** 2026-03-25

Strong architectural foundation with full accountability pipeline now operational. 100% test coverage enforced. 12 ADRs documented. Multi-app structure with strict isolation. Showcase app fully tested. Accountability pipeline exercised with 3 permits, 2 journals, 2 inspection reports filed. Brick-catalog removed and all references cleaned (PR #133). Adapter-store and resource-adapter patterns battle-tested — sets domain consumes all CRUD operations (create, patch, delete, list, getById). No critical gaps remaining.

## Active Concerns

| Concern                                  | Severity | Status     | Notes                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Item` type constraint mismatch          | Low      | Aware      | `FamilySet` has `id` but no `createdAt`/`updatedAt` — may surface in future domains         |
| Test guard warnings (3 files)            | Low      | Monitoring | 780ms / 550ms / 486ms under coverage — warning zone, not breaching 1000ms failure threshold |
| `format:check` failures on `.claude/` md | Low      | Known      | oxfmt reformats markdown — agent docs and journal files drift; not a code defect            |

## Seeds

**Assessed:** 2026-03-25

Ideas planted but deferred — revisit when the trigger condition is met. Seeds are not tech debt (known problems) or active concerns (things needing attention now). They're **future improvements** that aren't worth the cost today but will be when the codebase grows.

| Seed                                 | Trigger                                                                              | What It Means                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Territory briefing for architect     | When 3+ domains use adapter-store (currently 1: sets)                                | Consolidated intel doc so the architect doesn't read 5 docs before starting. The pulse partially fills this role, but a briefing would include directory structure, key conventions, and known deviations in one place |
| Third agent type (domain specialist) | When domain count exceeds 10, or when cross-domain patterns need dedicated attention | A domain-scoped agent that understands one vertical slice deeply. Currently unnecessary — 7 domains is manageable for a generalist architect                                                                           |
| Inspector memory file                | After 3+ inspector missions (currently at 2)                                         | Persistent assessment file (like spy memory) so the inspector tracks quality trends across missions instead of starting fresh each time. Trigger approaching — one more mission.                                       |
